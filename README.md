# Percolation
Percolation project that I have done at University Massachusetts Boston and was developed in java.  
Percolation is a system that simulates the behavior of a percolated system. Percolation is when the system finds a path where it can go 
from top connected sites to the bottom open sites. Not all systems percolate and the model demonstrates and tests to see if the given 
system percolates and provides a visual example.
